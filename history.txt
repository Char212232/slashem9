  +-------+
  | Rogue |
  +-------+

	In the beginning, there was Rogue.  Made by Michael Toy, Glenn Wichman,
and Ken Arnold, it was revolutionary at the time it came out for no other reason
than that it had graphics.  It ushered in a new era of games called
roguelikes--games like Rogue.  It ran on a BSD system, in a time before Linux
took over the unix stage and BSD split into three.  Sadly, it was closed source.
Never to be the open source community released numerous clones of rogue like
Moria and Larn.


  +------+
  | Hack |
  +------+

	One of these clones, the one of that stayed closest to its roots in
Rogue, was called Hack.  The first version was made by Jay Fenlason, but alas:
only a DOS binary survives of his version.  Andries Brouwer took Jay's code,
revised it heavily, and made it public.  It wasn't until April 2015 that the
final portions of Andries Brouwer's Hack v1.0 was recovered.  But Andries could
only hack for so long.  After version 1.03, Hack development stalled.  Mike
Stephenson took this Hack, relicensed it, repackaged it, and founded a DevTeam
to work on it.  This iteration was called NetHack because it was Hack, but
developed over the 'Net.


  +---------+
  | NetHack |
  +---------+

	Ahhh, NetHack developers.  This mysterious group consisted of--and to
this day (purportedly) consists of--a mythical group of people called the
NetHack DevTeam, or just the DevTeam.  Secretive, releasing late and
infrequently, they are nevertheless revered.  But eventually this came to an
end.  For a long time, there had been a traditions of patches and modifications
to NetHack, but none caught on.  Tom Proudfoot combined two variants of NetHack,
NetHack-- (previously named NetHack++, but later renamed to avoid confusion that
it was written in C++) and NetHack Plus to form a patch called SLASH, short for
Super Lotsa Added Stuff Hack.  Then, finally, Warren Cheung freed us all from
the DevTeam's hegemony, the combination this SLASH patch with another called the
Wizard Patch made Slash'EM: Super Lotsa Added Stuf Hack -- Extended Magic.


  +----------+
  | Slash'EM |
  +----------+

	Slash'EM was one of the most successful variants of all time.  Even
years after its release, when other variants--notably UnNetHack and NetHack4--
took center stage, Slash'EM remained popular.  It didn't last long, though.  It
claimed to be everything that anybody could have wanted in NetHack: releasing
early, releasing often, not stopping development for years at a time with no
explanation.  Yet it ceased development only three years after NetHack's
apparent stymie in 2003.  The saga of NetHack was far from over, however.
Patric Mueller's UnNetHack, purporting to add randomness, challenges, and fun,
started development in 2009.  Daniel Thaler's NitroHack was the base for quite
a few variants; tungtn combined it with UnNetHack to make DynaHack, and Alex
Smith combined it with his own AceHack to create NetHack4.  NetHack4 also fed
into DynaHack and spawned Nathan Eady's NetHack Fourk and Fredrik Ljungdahl's
FIQHack.  dNetHack appeared in 2012.  And, of course, there was Slash'EM extended.


  +-------------------+
  | Slash'EM Extended |
  +-------------------+

	Slash'EM Extended is possibly the most outrageous and bloated descendant
of NetHack.  Its codebase weighs in at 68 megabytes, over 10 times as large as
NetHack's codebase.  It has nearly 50,000 different kinds of monsters!  Despite
these clear superiorities, however, some believe it to be bloated or unbalanced.
We can assure you that they are sadly misinformed; however, it is still
illustrative to learn the tale of a variant gone wrong: SlashTHEM.


  +-----------+
  | SlashTHEM |
  +-----------+

	SlashTHEM, short for Super Lotsa Added Stuff -- The Heavily Extended
Mod, was developed by an unnamed entity known only as 'Soviet5lo'.  It was
created to 'fix' Slash'EM Extended.  It provides 'bug fixes' (remember, it's not
a bug, it's a feature!), balance 'improvements' (do you call an easier game more
balanced?) and a much milder codebase, with only 2,630 monsters.


  +---------------+
  | Slash'EM-Next |
  +---------------+

	Finally, in June 2017, Elronnd got annoyed at the general lack of
Slash'EM (the original Slash'EM DevTeam are long dead; I killed them), so he
decided to do something about it.
The end~
