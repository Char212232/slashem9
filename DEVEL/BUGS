* Curses seems to sporadically enter a couple of infinite loops?  I had it happen once after enabling perm_invent where it refreshed forever taking up 100% cpu and then eventually segfaulted; that was probably stack overflow.  Another time it printed out 'Hello elronnd, welcome to SlashEM-Next!  You are a neutral female elven' a stupid number of times (took several seconds to finish).  (Possibly because it kept wanting to print out the second part of the message?)
* When you reduce the window size, curses wants to display its messages again and makes you <space> again
* Input lag in curses

* Make overview/wizardmode levport show nicer names for special levels ('Storage Room' instead of 'stor', 'The Guild of Disgruntled Adventurers' instead of 'guild', etc.)

* ? on #adjust doesn't work properly
