* Curses seems to sporadically enter a couple of infinite loops?  I had it happen once after enabling perm_invent where it refreshed forever taking up 100% cpu and then eventually segfaulted; that was probably stack overflow.  Another time it printed out 'Hello elronnd, welcome to SlashEM-Next!  You are a neutral female elven' a stupid number of times (took several seconds to finish).  (Possibly because it kept wanting to print out the second part of the message?)
* When you reduce the window size, curses wants to display its messages again and makes you <space> again
* Input lag in curses

* Make overview/wizardmode levport show nicer names for special levels ('Storage Room' instead of 'stor', 'The Guild of Disgruntled Adventurers' instead of 'guild', etc.)

* ? on #adjust doesn't work properly

* Wizmode-teleported on top of hole in castle, and got a segfault in hack.c:1858 (if ((mtmp = m_at(u.ux, u.uy)) && !u.uswallow)).  Debugger was useless and couldn't repro.

* Crash in dofire() where it apparently gets down to throw_obj() and uquiver is null at that point.

* Bad strength display in tcc.  Bug in its vararg handling?

* Segfault w/tcc.  Can reproduce with bones file.  Stacktrace:
