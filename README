This is a slashem variant.  Take a look.  Or don't.  Whatever suits your fancy.  There isn't much yet.



!Warning!
It is currently VERY volatile.  The version number of 0.0.0E0F0 reflects this.

Saves may break at any time.

Crashes and other bugs will be frequent.

In the future, techniques will be implemented that (hopefully) reduce the rate
of save breakage, but that's a LONG way out.

You should still play it, though!  It's fun, and it's better than vanilla slashem!
