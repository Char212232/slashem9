This is a slashem variant.  Take a look.  Or don't.  Whatever suits your fancy.  There's not much to see yet.  Mainly a standard complement of all the bug fixes and ui enhancements that slashem has missed over the last 15 years.  See TODO for a tentative list of ideas for things to maybe do/add at some point.



!Warning!
It is currently VERY volatile.  The version number of 0.0.0E0F0 reflects this.

Saves may break at any time.

Crashes and other bugs will be frequent.

In the future, techniques will be implemented that (hopefully) reduce the rate
of save breakage, but that's a LONG way out.

You should still play it, though!  It's fun, and it's better than vanilla slashem!
