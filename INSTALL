Slash'EM Variant uses autotools.  To build, simply type the following:

mkdir build; cd build
../configure --prefix=$HOME/slashem-install --with-owner=`whoami` --with-group=`whoami`
make install

This will install Slash'EM Variant into ~/slashem-install.  Change this if you know what you are doing and want to do something different.

Other build systems are unmaintained; they will probably be fixed if they are broken and someone points it out, but they are not guaranteed to to work.
