Slash'EM Variant uses autotools.  To build, simply type the following:

mkdir build; cd build
../configure --prefix=$HOME/slashem-install --with-owner=`whoami` --with-group=`whoami`
make install

This will install Slash'EM Variant into ~/slashem-install.  Change this if you know what you are doing and want to do something different.

Other build systems are maintained, and will probably be fixed if they are broken and someone points it out, but are not guaranteed to continue to work.
