* Note: features intentionally not present from nethack:
 - Thrown potions have a chance to hit a steed's saddle.  I think this is a cool idea, but I think it's not worth having unless it can do more.
 - Elbereth changes.  There will more than likely be elbereth changes, but not those.

* Make rogue level only show up on rogue's birthday per https://github.com/UnNetHack/UnNetHack/commit/7b02e60db76d45c2c91bc7281d288e6b64182005#commitcomment-32053355, once dungeon switches to lua?

* Replace pretty much all uses of void* with anything.

* Curses seems to sporadically enter a couple of infinite loops?  I had it happen once after enabling perm_invent where it refreshed forever taking up 100% cpu and then eventually segfaulted; that was probably stack overflow.  Another time it printed out 'Hello elronnd, welcome to SlashEM-Next!  You are a neutral female elven' a stupid number of times (took several seconds to finish).  (Possibly because it kept wanting to print out the second part of the message?)
* When you reduce the window size, curses wants to display its messages again and makes you <space> again
* Input lag in curses
* Investigate: would people be ok with no curses, but a rich sdl|gtk interface?  I kind of hate curses
* SDL can't be very rich, gtk is stupid on windows.  Need to re-integrate nethackw?

* Completely revamp interface:
 * More support for nhstr
  * Support attrs (bg, italic, inverse?, bold)
  * Allow to stuff tiles into an nhstr (so the ';' command can work sensibly w/tiles and the gamemap can be implemented in terms of putstr)
  * Message colours
 * Update proxy graphics.
 * win32, cocoa, gtk, android, ios windowports.  See README
 * web windowport?  https://github.com/coolwanglu/BrowserHack

* Integrate boehm gc?
 * Probably not
 * Re-evaluate once nhstr is pervasive

* Rewrite MAIL (actual email checking doesn't make sense, but there are a couple of other things that we might want):
 * Dgl mail
 * In-game chat system (integrate with #shout)
 * IRC notifications (write IRC plugin to make it log messages to a file and slashem pick them up)
  * Discord? (ugh)

* The ascension run: make it interesting.  No one likes the the WOY randomly appearing, and that only happens in order to make it more interesting than just "go up the stairs, rinse, repeat."  Also, the wizard appearing on the plane of earth cheapens him.  He should disappear after you perform the ritual and not come back.  Maybe make a group of high-level monsters appear every time you go up the stairs with the AOY?

* The castle: I like it.  Get rid of the wand of wishing and instead add more loot.  Some ideas: Currently, there are two barracks.  Instead of barracks, make each of those rooms contain 2/3 randomly of: barracks, unicorns, dragons.  Right now, there's a room of weapons, armour, food, and gems.  Gems are irrelevant, and food can be gotten elsewhere.  Replace it with 4/5 of: weapons, armour, scrolls, rings, and wands.
