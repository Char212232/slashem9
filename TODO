* Replace pretty much all uses of void* with anything.

* Completely revamp interface:
 * Make windowports support printing coloured text.  (Maybe make them take coloured_character* instead of char* and then have builder functions and wrappers so it's not a total pain)
  * Then add message colours
 * Update proxy graphics.


* Integrate boehm gc

* Integrate libtre (or maybe gnu regex) and use that instead of relying on regex from the system

* ANSI-ify everything (~half done)

* Remove support for platforms no one uses, and in doing so improve maintainability and support on platforms people actually use

* Rewrite MAIL (actual email checking doesn't make sense, but there are a couple of other things that we might want):
 * Dgl mail
 * In-game chat system (integrate with #shout)
 * IRC notifications (write IRC plugin to make it log messages to a file and slashem pick them up)

* Delete and then rewrite FILE_AREAS

* The ascension run: make it interesting.  No one likes the mysterious force or the WOY randomly appearing, and that only happens in order to make it simpler than just "go up the stairs, rinse, repeat."  Also, the wizard appearing on the plane of earth cheapens him.  He should disappear after you perform the ritual and not come back until then.  Maybe make a group of high-level monsters appear every time you go up the stairs with the AOY?

* Gehenna: it's obviously terrible.  Rip it out completely and think about: what's a good thing to go in between the castle and the vibrating square?  If ais ever finishes his sokoban generator, maybe use that.  It should be a puzzle of some sort, and just "high-powered enemies" doesn't differentiate it from the first half of the game.  Perhaps there's a series of levels, and on each one you suffer some kind of debuff.  Maybe you're burdened, or hallucinating (which is an actual debuff because slashem), or your maximum hp is halved.  Perhaps the very next level after VotD is the invokation level, and it has 9 (obviously undiggable) concentric circles representing dante's 9 circles of hell.  Each door you go through, you get something like the effects of a fire trap, but much stronger (increasing as you get farther in).  Fire resistance won't help, or if it will, it'll be just a little.  (Maybe put the vibrating square on a gehenna-maze-like level, just to be annoying.

* The castle: I like it.  Get rid of the wand of wishing and instead add more loot.  Some ideas: Currently, there are two barracks.  Instead of barracks, make each of those rooms contain 2/3 randomly of: barracks, unicorns, dragons.  Right now, there's a room of weapons, armour, food, and gems.  Gems are irrelevant, and food can be gotten elsewhere.  Replace it with 4/5 of: weapons, armour, scrolls, rings, and wands.

* Add a "second quest." a la super mario bros or zelda.  Winning means you've won, but then your stats are randomly decreased by 1-3 each (average decrease should be 1.3-ish), level is halved or quartered (and hp/pw are set accordingly), skills you get to keep 3 of, *but* you get to unrestrict 1 or 2 skills, and you get to keep some number (maybe 9?) of your items.  Let's say this is because you got fat hanging around in the after life.  Now, you have to get back from astral to level 1, go up the stairs, and return home.

* Speaking of which, you use a magic portal to get from dlvl1 to the plane of earth.  It opens once you get the amulet, closes after one use, but reopens after you ascend.
