* ANSI-ify everything (~half done)
* Remove support for platforms no one uses, and in doing so improve maintainability and support on platforms people actually use
* Delete and later rewrite MAIL (actual email checking doesn't make sense, but there are a couple of other things that we might want):
 * Dgl mail
 * In-game chat system (integrate with #shout)
 * IRC notifications (write IRC plugin to make it log messages to a file and slashem pick them up)

* Delete and later rewrite FILE_AREAS
